Whistlepost
===========

A content management system (CMS) designed to be as simple as Jekyll, as flexible as Adobe AEM, and as robust as Wordpress.

## Architecture

Whistlepost is built on the Apache Sling platform, which applies the mantra that everything is a resource. The benefit of this approach is that is separates the structure of the content from the structure of the site itself, which allows both (UX/UI) designers and (content) developers to focus on what is most important to them.
